    <p><br>&emsp;&emsp;Chemistry is based on experiments, as we all know, chemistry student experiments are about
      exploring, finding and learning. And now, I, a big bird, will give you some constructive suggestions on it, after
      many hours of discussion with expert from Guangdong and eating with the director of high three grades.

    </p>
    <p><br>&emsp;&emsp;Firstly, we should let students know that interest is the best teacher, we should encourage
      students to ask for me. For example, a 3-grade student asked me that how many bonds a carbon atom has. Though it
      was a simple question, it could also inspire her. I quickly answered her in a scolding voice, “You are an idiot.
      There are 4 bonds in a carbon atom. ” Then I praised her very much, and she was so moved that tears were running
      down on her cheek. Finally, I said, “Get out of here!” She noticed. She did. Furthermore, she was inspired. Not
      only that, but she understood how to learn chemistry. It was all my hard work that was paid off. So this is a
      story of improving students' interests.

    </p>
    <p><br>&emsp;&emsp;Secondly, you should have some positive slavery in your class. The facts turned out to be good.
      The one of them was bullied online and cried to me for help. With them, I can make the whole class not so naughty
      and the amount of slavery will also rise. At the same time, given that studying chemistry is one of the most important
      things during High school learning, I will make good use of my status, for example, cutting the spare time of
      students as much as possible. I know that there are many students speak ill of me and call me “鹏豖郡主” But I won't
      apply to them for knowing my opinion of gaining more money. Then I will also use methods including PUA.

    </p>
    <p><br>&emsp;&emsp;From my perspective, not only the chemistry education but also the promotion of the career is
      based on your self-ability. Having experienced such a long time in the school, I have formed a strong bond with
      the school which I deeply love. I was very moved that there were many students celebrating my leave. Under the
      surface of the celebration, there must be unforgettable feeling in their mind. This thing happened to me very
      often, and I give honor to my teacher method, I think as a head teacher of one class you must take the teacher
      measure of all soft and tough. There are two examples.

    </p>
    <p><br>&emsp;&emsp;The first one I want to say is about the boy mentioned. Yes, he's a boy who was bullied on the
      internet because of his carelessness, and his chemistry grade dropped rapidly. So I wanted to have a talk with him
      when we come to have a word with me. I suddenly found that his chart wasn't filled completely according to my
      method. I seriously asked him to follow it next to me, as I was observing him following the chart, another student
      came to my office. In order to save time, I quit observing him and I had a talk with the student coming later
      then. There was a thing out of my thought happened. According to students who came late said that when he talked
      with me, he first found the boy wore his glasses upside down and when the boy lowered his head, the glass fell
      down from his head. At first, I didn’t care about these things, but a few minutes later, the boy's nose started
      bleeding. He took the tissue nearby to block the blood from getting outside, but he failed obviously, as he
      heightened his hand and asked me if he could get out to clean his nose. I agreed with him. But I didn't still make
      sense of this thing. Till the boy was back later, we found that there was blood everywhere on his body: face,
      arms, legs, even clothes. I was scared. No sooner I tried to come down than he said that “Mrs Zhao, I couldn't
      make it to a stop.”“F! ”But it's my duty to ensure him safety. So I helped him. I first let him clean himself, but
      he only gently let the water stream on his forehead. It was no use! How stupid! I couldn't stand him, and I said,
      let me help you. I turned up the tap and used all of my strength to press his head heavily. Sooner, I found that
      it couldn't work in this way. So I turned to the student for help. He said that you could ask your good student
      SCY for help. He also had a similar experience before. Thinking twice, I finally decided to ask his parents to
      take him to the hospital, after that I asked the student the reason. He said that he must have a fair burning in
      his heart. And I started to think wrong is me or wrong leads to the tendency, but when I saw the boy come back
      alive. My relieved, my royal slavery come back then. I started to think he's absent from the weekly test. That's
      all what happened.

    </p>
    <p><br>&emsp;&emsp;And the second thing was about the passion. I think I'm the most energetic teacher that you've
      ever met. I can prepare for class to the minute, or more accurately, 12:30 a.m. Likewise, I'm very delighted to
      solve everyone's question. By the way, I'm very good at wondering every time I want to take a walk, my followers
      will spare no efforts. To follow me, I think that I am familiar with Gandhi in some ways, Such as giving everyone
      you have and help fighting against health and so on, but not to the shape and sex. Everyone who saw me would leave
      me greetings, and I also replied to them with a strict but kind smile. I think that the Center of the school
      varies, but it's always located at where I stand. When I was teaching my students, I'm always in high voice and do
      whatever I can to make them understood. I will tell them SO2 during class. Furthermore, I also let them know that
      the professors like Sodium Thiosulfate, for they can hold a 1-hour lecture just introducing it. I'm the master of
      ass. Surely there are some awkward times to be tackled, but I will make the plain. I still remember that I mistook
      a for b, which means, say. Everyone smiled, except my royal slavery. I could distinguish his name heart from
      others’ desolation hearts. I think that I must pull it through. With the help of heart and passion, I did it.
      After class, I invited some students who laughed at me during class to my office, and thanked them for reminding
      me that enthusiasm came first. My student called me Tang Seng for a kind but a little weird heart. But I
      considered myself as “Zhu Ba Jie”（猪霸杰）for always had a passion for work, even though at times I'm stupid and lazy.

    </p>
    <p><br>&emsp;&emsp;I think teaching students it's like planting a tree. All you need to do is just to water them,
      including watering them Nutrition and poisons. In the next year, I will do my best to help every classmate as much
      as I can, so that every classmate can feel my broad and fat mind and the warmth of home. I will fully spread my
      nutrients to the hearts of every classmate.
